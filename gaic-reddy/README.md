# Global-big-data-conference-Jan2018

Welcome to Global Big Data Conf in Jan 2018. I have added some files in this repo. Please do the following. 
Step1: Create a seperate directory. 
Step2: Please download all the files in this repo into that directory. 

If you could not, do not worry. I will discuss them in the workshop.

Also complete the following few tasks. 
Task(1): Install any python editor of your choice. I prefer PyCharm Community Edition 2016.3 (though a later version is available, I had difficulties in running it on my iMac). You can find the relevant links here. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/previous.html. I will use the editor to view and code and discuss. 
Task(2): Install Anaconda Navigator. This will help you install certain basic packages like Numpy, Pandas, Keras, etc. (https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/). I may talk about these packages but nevertheless you need these packages for future ML experiments
Task(3): Please download nltk and all the text corpora available at http://www.nltk.org/. (Optional: In addition, you MAY also get Core NLP from Stanford at https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/.) 


I am excited to about the workshop. As you can image, NLP is tranforming the world. I will explain NLP concepts and discuss tips on how to use NLP and build solutions.

Here are some statements to keep in mind: 
(a) I assume that you are familiar with programming, preferably python. 
(b) The course is not about teaching programing. It is about teaching how NLP works, explain various concepts in NLP and show a few exampes of existing code snippets in python that implement NLP concepts. 
(c) Developing NLP solutions using frameworks (like Tensorflow, Caffe2, PyTorch, MLlib, etc.) is increasingly becoming easier. What remains difficult is the basic understanding of NLP concepts. Here is where I will try to spend more time.
(d) Be prepared to ask a lot of questions.
